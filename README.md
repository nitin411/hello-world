hello world
i am nitin shrivastava who loves music and coding (deadly combo)
my friends call me 'tintin' but i have a decided my signature to be " i! " 
I write my name as follows
" NiT!N "
I wanted my github profile to be 'i!' but this fucking world does not understand me. They want letter and numbers only and i am too bored with alphabets and numbers -_-
